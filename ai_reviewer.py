# - GITHUB_TOKEN: allows the script to authenticate back to GitHub and post comments
# - MISTRAL_API_KEY: your Mistral API key stored as a GitHub secret
# - GITHUB_REPOSITORY: "owner/repo" format (e.g., "user/myproject")
# - GITHUB_PR_NUMBER: pull request number triggered by the workflow

# 2. Define HTTP headers for GitHub API calls (auth + JSON content)
headers = {"Authorization": f"token {github_token}", "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json"}

# 3. Build the URL to fetch all changed files (diffs/patches) from the PR
files_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/files"

# 4. Make GET request to GitHub to get all file changes in the PR
response = requests.get(files_url, headers=headers)
files = response.json()  # JSON response contains filename + diff (patch)

# 5. Collect all the code patches (diff hunks) into a single string
diffs = []
for f in files:
    patch = f.get("patch")  # each file may or may not have a diff
    if patch:
        diffs.append(f"File: {f['filename']}\n{patch}")  # label by filename

# 6. Join all diffs into one big text block (to send to the AI model)
code_diff = "\n\n".join(diffs)

# 7. Prepare the review prompt for Mistral.
# We instruct the model to act like a senior engineer and review the diff.
prompt = f"""
You are a senior software engineer. 
Review the following code changes and provide constructive feedback:
- Identify potential bugs
- Suggest best practices
- Point out missing tests or documentation
- Mention possible performance improvements

# - messages: conversation with the AI (we only need one user message here)
# - max_tokens: cap the length of response

# 13. Build the URL to post a comment back into the PR (comments API is under "issues")

# 14. Create the body of the comment with AI review text, include a ðŸ¤– label

# 16. Print a log message (useful for debugging in GitHub Actions logs)
print("âœ… AI review (Mistral) posted successfully!")
